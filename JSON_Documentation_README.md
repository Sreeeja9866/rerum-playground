What is JSON? <br />

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): <br />

JSON is a simple way to store and send information between computers. Think of it like a person's case file, but for data. JSON organizes information using curly braces {}, square brackets [], and colons :. It's easy for both humans and computers to read. <br />

For example, a person's details in JSON might look like this: <br />

{ <br />
   "name": "Jane Doe", <br />
   "age": 28, <br />
   "jobTitle": Software Engineer <br />
} <br />

JSON is used widely on the internet to send data between a server (like a website's backend) and a user's browser. <br />


What is JSON-LD? <br />
JSON-LD (JSON for Linked Data): <br />
JSON-LD is like a more savvier JSON. It does everything JSON does, but adds context to the data. This context helps computers understand the meaning of the data, not just its structure. <br />

For instance, when JSON-LD sees "name," it can understand that it's talking about a person's name, not a pet's name or a company's name. This makes it easier for different systems to work together and understand each other's data. <br />

JSON-LD has an element called @context, which is  like a dictionary that explains what the terms in your data mean. It links your data to standardized definitions on the internet. <br />

For example, <br />
{ <br />
  "@context": "https://www.com", <br />
  "name": "Jane Doe", <br />
  "jobTitle": "Software Developer" <br />
} <br />

Here, "@context": "https://www.com" tells computers to look up the meanings of "name" and "jobTitle" on www.com. This helps ensure that different systems interpret the data in the same way. <br />

Below are some websites that provide more details regarding JSON, JSON-LD, and @context element of JSON-LD, as well as a web application that functions as a JSON-LD playground: <br />
