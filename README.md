# Rerum Playground
This is a web space that uses the RERUM installation at the Walter J. Ong,<sub><sup> S.J.</sup></sub> Center for Digital Humanities to explore the possibilities of interoperable tools and standards. By using the Tiny Things sandbox, users can immediately create reusable JSON-LD objects that conform to IIIF and Web Annotation standards and find new ways to interact with them.
